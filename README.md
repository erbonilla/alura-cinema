## 🎬 AI-Powered Movie App with React JS (2024)

This is project where I explored the latest features of **React JS** by building a complete, fully responsive **AI-powered movie application**.

The idea was to go beyond a typical movie listing site — integrating **voice AI**, **real-time data**, **user authentication**, and **modern UI/UX components** using **Material UI**.  
The goal? Build a smart, interactive web app that delivers a powerful user experience.
